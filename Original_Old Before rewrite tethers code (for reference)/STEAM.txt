Power Cables
TESTING ONLY
It is not done, cable connections don't save yet. This release is just for testing.

Usage:
Place down a "charging staton" and right click on it and then move to any other non-connected grid and right click any terminal block to connect.
NOTE
Static grids can have cables reach up to 100 meters.
Dynamic grids (ships/wheeled vehicles etc) can only reach up to 20 meters.
To disconnect a grid, either move it beyond 20 meters or repeat the same steps as you want to connect, only it will disconnect any connected grids.
When a grid is connected, it doesn't matter which terminal block you right click on, it will disconnect by default.

TODO
Add persistent connections.
Add more connection blocks variety.
Add special cable socket blocks rather then being able to connect cables on any terminal block.
LOD models for the various blocks.
Terminal list containing currently connected grids and ability to sever/disconnect them.

Huge thanks to KLIME that the code is based of.
This will be a substitute until the real power cables mod by Churrosaur gets finished.

DO NOTE THAT THIS WILL SAVE BOTH GRIDS WHEN MAKING BLUEPRINTS
